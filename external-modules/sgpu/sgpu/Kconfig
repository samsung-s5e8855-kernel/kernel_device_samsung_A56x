	  GVF(GPU Virtual Frequency) is a GPU power control function to imitate

	  reduces GPU power more extremely to meet target performance in sustain

	  If GPU does have memory coherent with the host CPUs, GPU drivers
	  should make sure the GPU bufffers shared with CPU are coherent.
	  The cost of extra SW overhead for memory coherency can be significant
	  while the latency of an access to write-combining memory is dramatically
	  slow. Set n if PAL is able to handle all memory coherency for cacheable
	  buffer objects and performance impact of SW overhead for memory coherency
	  is neglectable.
