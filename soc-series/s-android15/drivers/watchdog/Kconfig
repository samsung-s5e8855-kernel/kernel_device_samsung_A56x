	  This external driver were copied from original linux mainline.
	  We are modifying this driver as module, but mainline cannot accept
	  recent driver changes. So, detatch from mainline and modify here.

	  Watchdog timer block in the Samsung SoCs. This will reboot
	  the system when the timer expires with the watchdog enabled.

	  The driver is limited by the speed of the system's PCLK
	  signal, so with reasonably fast systems (PCLK around 50-66MHz)
	  then watchdog intervals of over approximately 20seconds are
	  unavailable.

	  The driver can be built as a module by choosing M, and will
	  be called s3c2410_wdt

	  This config disable the shutdown function of S3C2410 watchdog.
	  To prevent stuck after watchdog driver shutdown, shutdown
	  function will not stop or disable watchdog and it will just
	  kick 30 second. It will prevent being stucked in reset
	  sequence with some other failure.
	  This feature is not recommeneded for debugging.

	  Supports direct WDT reset API for builtin call only.
	  S3C2410_WATCHDOG driver support normal watchdog feature including
	  direct watchdog reset API. But when it works as kernel module,
	  builtin APIs cannot use it.
	  So, support direct WDT reset API only for SOC debug purpose.

	  This config will set Maximum WDT count value.
	  If you don't set, default value is 0xffff.
